######### Adding Project to Github using Github #########

ON GITHUB:
- Create a new repository
- Do not initialize with README, license, or gitignore files

# Navigate to the local project directory
cd /Local_Repo

# Initialize the local directory as a Git repository
git init

# Add the files in your local repository. Stages for first commit
git add .

# Commit staged files in the local repository
git commit -m "First commit"

ON GITHUB:
- Copy remote repository URL

# Add the URL for the remote repository where the local repository will be pushed
git remote add origin <remote repository url>
    # Sets the new remote URL
git remote -v
    # Verifies the new remote URL

# Push the new changes in your local repository to Github
git push -u origin master
    # Pushes changes in the local repo to the remote repo specified as the origin

######### Errors during Phase 1 ######### 
# Error: Non-fast forward error
 [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jdrapss/Modern-Python-3-Bootcamp.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
# Solution 1:
git pull https://github.com/*username*/*repository*.git master
    # Pull remote repository
git init
git add . 
git commit -m "update"
    # Re-initialized local repository
git push
    # push changes to remote repository

# Solution 2:
# Fetching and merging changes made on the remote branch with changes made locally:
git fetch origin
    # Fetch updates made to an online repository
git merge origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
    # Merge updates made online with your local work

# Solution 3: 
# git pull performs both fetch and merge at once
git pull origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
    # Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work

######### Adding a file to a repository using the command line #########
