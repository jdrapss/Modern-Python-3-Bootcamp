## Declaring Strings ##
# String literals in Python can be declared with either single or double quotes.
# Either type is completely okay, just make sure you are using a consistent quote convention
# throughout the same file.

# You can have quotes inside of quotes
msg = "he said 'hello there!'" # Must use different type of quote inside a quote to avoid syntax errors
print(msg) # he said 'hello there'!
