# Bank Robbery Money Exercise
# I just robbed a bank with some friends. We got away with 
# $19,867,324,678,987.99, and now we have to split it up 5 ways.
# Using the "cash" variable I've already defined for you, print out
# the dollar amount each robber gets to keep (divide "cash" by 5 and print the answer out)

# Set cash variable 
cash = 19867324678987.99
print(cash / 5)
# Returns 3973464935797.5977
