# Naming Restrictions
# Variables must start with a lettor or underscore (No numbers)
# The rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscores
# Names are case-sensitve

# Naming Conventions
# Most Python programmers prefer to use standard style conventions when naming things
# Most variables should be "snake_case" (underscores between words)
# Most variables should be lowercase, with some exceptions:
    # CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (ex: PI = 3.14)
    # UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class 
# Variables that start and end with two underscores (called "dunder" for Double UNDERscore)
# are supposed to be private or left alone:
    # Ex: __no_touchy__
